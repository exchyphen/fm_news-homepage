## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

### What I learned

Lots of practice on HTML/CSS, especially with positioning.
Good practice on creating a simple navbar.
New experience of creating a pop up navigation menu, dimming the background (on mobile format).

### Useful resources

- [Refresher on useEffect in React](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) - wanted to use this to trigger things like the hero image from desktop to mobile instead of using a media query in CSS.
